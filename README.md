# Customer_Segmentation_Assignment

Overview
This project involves analyzing customer data to extract meaningful insights and group customers into distinct segments using clustering techniques. The repository is divided into three main sections: EDA, Lookalike Model, and Clustering. Each section includes the code and corresponding reports.

Repository Structure
EDA:
Sudhashini_Enugula_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with the Exploratory Data Analysis.
Sudhashini_Enugula_EDA.pdf: PDF report summarizing the EDA insights.
Lookalike_Model:
Sudhashini_Enugula_Lookalike.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for the lookalike model.
Sudhashini_Enugula_Lookalike.csv: CSV file with lookalike model predictions.
Clustering:
Sudhashini_Enugula_Clustering.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for customer segmentation.
Sudhashini_Enugula_Clustering.pdf: PDF report summarizing the clustering process and results.
